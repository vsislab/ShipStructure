# Ship vision critical area exploration

## Introduction
This code is used to train different models for ship classification tasks, including both pure image classification and classification guided by the addition of key regions, in addition to conducting structure-texture generation experiments, Class Activation Mapping(CAM) image visualization of ship images, etc.

## Code Overview
The structure of this code is to add functions to the general image classification. The main building block functions include

* ./data: Dataset annotation and associated scripts and image storage locations.
* ./configs: Parameter configuration module.
* ./model: Our main model with all its building blocks.
* ./utils: Utility functions for training, inference, and postprocessing.
* ./scripts: Scripts related to model training, inference, image and code download, visualization.
* ./visualization: CAM image visualization and experimental performance saving.

## Installation
If the data is slow to download or the file is missing, you can contact us by email and ask for the data without commercial or other use.
**Environment installation and data preparation**
```shell
conda create -n ships_class python==3.6
conda activate ships_class
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh ./scripts/data_preparation_class.sh
sh ./scripts/data_preparation.sh
```

**Training Classification Networks**

The following code is introduced using the ResNet family of networks as an example.

* The following describes the training of networks using the vanilla version of the data.

```shell
sh ./scripts/train_resnet_vallinia.sh
```

* The following describes the training of networks using data guided by key regions.

```shell
sh ./scripts/train_resnet_add.sh
```
* CAM image visualization
If further exploration of the CAM image is required, the raw data is stored in *.npy.
```shell
sh ./scripts/cam_download.sh
sh ./scripts/cam_vallina_resnet.sh
sh ./scripts/cam_add_resnet.sh
```

**Structure-Texture Generation Network**
For generating network selection, we used [CycleGAN and pix2pix in PyTorch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix "CycleGAN and pix2pix in PyTorch"), without any additional modifications, and completed the experiments using only paired ship structure-texture images as data.

* Data preparation and training
```shell
sh ./scripts/gan_download.sh
```

* Testing with test dataset
```shell
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/ships --name ships_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA --num_test 1000 --epoch 200
```

* Testing with multi-view structural images generated from 3d data
```shell
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/multi_view_ships --name ships_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA --num_test 114 --epoch 200
```
